# Work in Progress

This is a work still in Progress. First of all as a JavaFX Application (I want to learn a little bit JavaFX). Later probably as an Executable File.

## Possible right now:
1. Create Armor Sets
2. Save and load them
3. Import and export them

## Things to add (not particularly in this order):
1. Setskills
2. Groupskills
3. Decorations
4. More Info for Armor (description, crafting requirements, def_base and max, etc.)
5. Weapons
6. Charms
7. Visuals (obviously)
